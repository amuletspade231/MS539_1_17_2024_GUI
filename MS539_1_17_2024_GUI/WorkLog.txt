I took a lot longer than I thought because I spent time on an error that didn't actually exist.
I also found out I had to redo how my program worked to fit my new features and that took some time as well.
Next time I want to include time for refactoring and such.

Most of my time was taken figuring out what to do to include the assignment objectives,
but I'm glad I was able to complete everything within my estimates.
If anything, as I was doing this assignment, I found more things to implement that I have to leave for the next increment.
I'm excited to try to implement calulated growth cycles and adding them to a 28 length array.
